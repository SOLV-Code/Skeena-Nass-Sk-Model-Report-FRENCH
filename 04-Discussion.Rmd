# DISCUSSION

This chapter is organized into three sections. In Section \@ref(KeyConsiderations) we discuss key considerations for the three analytical priorities that shaped the work presented in this paper: (1) enhanced production, (2) salmon population diversity, and (3) time-varying productivity. In Section \@ref(KeyConclusions) we highlight key conclusions from (1) spawner-recruit analyses, and (2) comparison of alternative approaches for developing aggregate management reference points. Section \@ref(PrioritiesFuture) discusses priorities for future work.

## KEY CONSIDERATIONS {#KeyConsiderations}


Key  considerations for developing management targets for Skeena and Nass Sockeye include the high proportion of enhanced Sockeye within the Skeena aggregate, the large number of component stocks with different production dynamics within each aggregate, and the question of how to address temporal shifts in productivity which is becoming increasingly common for salmon stocks throughout the North Pacific.


###  Enhanced Production

Enhanced Skeena Sockeye now account for a large proportion of the total Skeena Sockeye return in most years. From 1970-2020, the enhanced stocks (Pinkut and Fulton) accounted for an average of 67% of the total Skeena return (range 33-83%). We considered the wild (non-Pinkut and Fulton) and enhanced Skeena Sockeye stocks separately in our analyses, which focused on developing biological benchmarks at the stock and aggregate level for wild Skeena and Nass Sockeye stocks. While total Skeena Sockeye returns have increased considerably since the implementation of the BLDP, the realized benefits to fisheries were less than predicted (Hilborn 1992). 

One fundamental challenge for managing Skeena Sockeye is the tradeoff between reducing mixed stock fisheries to  protect smaller Skeena Sockeye stocks and increasing abundances of surplus enhanced fish arriving in Babine Lake to be locked out of the spawning channels. The number of enhanced Sockeye that exceed spawning capacity has decreased since 2000 but still represents a sizable proportion of the annual Skeena Sockeye return (Figure \@ref(fig:SurplusProduction)). The estimated surplus in 2020 exceeded the total number of Skeena Sockeye harvested in all fisheries. A portion of the surplus may be harvested in commercial ESSR (Excess Sockeye to spawning requirements) fisheries that occur in Babine Lake, but these fisheries do not take place every year. 

Sockeye escapement to the spawning channels, Pinkut Creek and Fulton Rivers have been relatively constant since the start of the BLDP, while total returns for both wild and enhanced Babine stocks (including catch, escapement, and surplus production), and the number of recruits produced per spawner, have decreased in recent decades, raising concerns about density dependence in freshwater and/or marine environments. Density dependence can affect productivity at multiple life history stages in both freshwater and marine environments, and at different scales. Some effects may be unique to a single stock or shared between many stocks within a region. For example, freshwater rearing capacity in Babine Lake controls the production of wild and enhanced Babine Sockeye, while density dependence in the marine environment can affect recruitment for Skeena, Nass, and other Sockeye stocks [@Peterman1982]. 

Babine smolt size has decreased continually over time, with the biggest decreases observed in the decades before the BLDP (Appendix \@ref(ChannelReview)). Smolt size is positively correlated with smolt to adult survival (SAS) [@HendersonCass], and size selective survival has been observed for Babine Sockeye [@WestLarkin]. There is a weak positive relationship between SAS and the mean length of smolts exiting Babine Lake, and a decreasing trend for smolt weight with increasing abundance, which suggests that freshwater density dependence may affect the size and survival of Babine smolts, but we do not have sufficient information to assess this at the stock level. While previous studies have concluded that lake rearing capacity is not a limiting factor for Babine Sockeye [@Shortreedetal2000PRModel], updated limnological studies have not taken place since 2013, and no reported data since 2000. 

The HBM results support a common shared year effect among Skeena Sockeye stocks, which suggests that limitations to recruitment occur on an aggregate scale. Covariation in productivity occurs at regional scales for different species and populations of Pacific salmon throughout the Northeast Pacific, [i.e., @PyperetalSpatialCov; @DorneretalCov]. Declines in Sockeye salmon populations in the Northeast Pacific region have been linked to the unprecedented abundance of Pacific salmon currently rearing in the Northeast Pacific following decades of large-scale enhancement of Pink and Chum Salmon originating from Asia and North America [@RuggeroneConnorsSxcomp].

Enhanced Babine stocks represent the largest component of Skeena Sockeye and are a key consideration for developing management targets. While wild Skeena and Nass stocks were the  focus of the biological benchmark analyses presented here, management reference points for Skeena Sockeye will need to consider the large contribution of enhanced Sockeye to the aggregate. From 1970-2020, the enhanced stocks (Pinkut and Fulton) accounted for an average of 67% of the total Skeena return (range 33-83%). Because loading targets for the spawning channels and managed sections of Pinkut Creek and Fulton River are set to achieve constant spawner densities that are maintained to maximize fry production, mathematical spawner-recruitment models such as the Ricker model, which require a range of spawner escapements (i.e., contrast in the data) may not produce useful parameter estimates. For stocks where spawning escapement is fixed, spawner recruit models and are not recommended for developing biological benchmarks or management targets for the enhanced stocks. Although the CSAS review committee generally acknowledged the challenges of conducting spawner recruit analyses for enhanced stocks with low contrast in the spawner escapement data, they recommended including spawner-recruit modelling results for the enhanced stocks in this Research Document. These results are presented in Appendix \@ref(PinkutFultonResults).

Our analyses considered the wild (non-Pinkut and Fulton) of Skeena Sockeye separately. In Sections \@ref(SpnEst) to \@ref(RunReconEst), we summarized estimation methods and run-reconstructions specific to Babine Sockeye, and assessed trends in surplus production. In  Section \@ref(SkeenaExpResults), we examined the ratio of wild and enhanced Skeena Sockeye to develop advice for expanding abundance-based reference points for the Skeena Wild aggregate to account for the enhanced contribution. 


### Salmon Population Diversity

The different Skeena and Nass stocks considered here include dozens of distinct Conservation Units which spawn in tributaries throughout both watersheds. For Skeena Sockeye, non-Babine Sockeye, with run sizes ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of spawners, represent a comparatively small proportion of the aggregate Skeena Sockeye return but account for most of the genetic diversity of the aggregate. From a conservation perspective, maintaining the evolutionary adaptive potential within a metapopulation is important for conserving resilience to future environmental changes [@Kardos2021GeneticVariation]. Within a metapopulation, asynchronous population dynamics among component populations confer resilience and stability of associated fisheries [e.g., @Hilborn2003Biocomplexity; @Schindleretal2010Portfolio], while more synchronous population dynamics increase variability in returns and for fisheries [@Freshwateretal2015WeakenedPortfolio]. For Skeena Sockeye, the loss of biodiversity since the start of the directed commercial fishery, characterized by decreased wild Skeena Sockeye returns combined with increased proportions of enhanced BLDP-origin Sockeye has been characterized as portfolio simplification [@Priceetal2021PortfolioSimpl].     

Existing genetic variation may allow populations to adapt more quickly to rapid environmental change [@Barrett2008]. Among Skeena and Nass Sockeye stocks, there are numerous examples where stock-level variation in population characteristics is measurable and likely contributes to asynchronous population dynamics among stocks. These Sockeye populations exhibit stock-specific diversity in life history patterns, smolt size, run timing, freshwater age and age-at-return. Diversity in freshwater age structure can buffer a population from poor marine conditions at different life history stages [@Moore2014LifeHistDiv]. Diversity in adult run timing may protect some stocks with different vulnerabilities to large-scale fisheries, while diversity in life history and smolt migration timing may attenuate year-class failures in years of reduced ocean survival [@Beamish2012], or reduce the risk of mismatch between timing of ocean entry and prey availability [i.e., @Satterthwaite2014; @CarrHarrisetal2018SmoltMigration]. 

Direct links between population characteristics and conservation and/or fisheries benefits are difficult to quantify, but there are numerous recent examples of population level changes that have helped to buffer Skeena and Nass Sockeye from low returns. In the Nass, the early-timed sea-type population accounted for up to 30% of the Nass Sockeye aggregate return in 2018 and 2019, when Sockeye returns to Meziadin fell below its escapement goal. Within the Meziadin stock complex, a relatively new spawning population (Strohn Creek), which has appeared in recent decades, now accounts for a substantial proportion of the Sockeye return (M. Cleveland, Gitanyow Fisheries Authority, pers. comm., 2021). For the Skeena, extremely low Sockeye returns in 2013, 2017 and 2019, which were driven by poor returns to Pinkut and Fulton, were buffered to an extent by returns to non-Babine Skeena Sockeye systems, which accounted for up to 25% of the aggregate Sockeye return, compared to just 10% in a typical year (unpublished DFO data).

If the relative abundance, or evenness of the different component populations is taken into account, there has been a substantial decrease in Sockeye diversity among Skeena and Nass Sockeye salmon since the start of large scale directed commercial fisheries at the beginning of the 20th century [@Priceetal2019Scales]. For many Skeena and Nass Sockeye populations, Indigenous history, early settler accounts and recent reconstructed historical abundances provide evidence of much larger returns than recent time series of escapements for these stocks. For instance, Sockeye escapements to the Kitwanga River, which likely exceeded tens of thousands at the start of the 20th century [@Priceetal2019Scales], have recently seen returns as low as 230 spawners in 2018. Kitwanga Sockeye are now the focus of an intensive recovery effort [@Cleveland2019KitwangaRecovery], and recovery planshave been initiated for other Skeena populations that have been considered  conservation concerns at different times, including Lakelse Sockeye and Morice Sockeye. 

An aggregate escapement goal that assumes long-term average productivity and stable stock composition may not protect less productive populations from overexploitation. Reduced diversity and increased synchrony may introduce additional management challenges [@Freshwateretal2020Selectivity]. Maintaining genetic and within-population diversity for aggregate salmon populations may protect fish populations and associated fisheries that depend on them may increase their resilience to environmental change [@Andersonetal2015Portfolio; @Kardos2021GeneticVariation].  


The diversity of Sockeye populations has been a key consideration throughout the Skeena and Nass Sockeye escapement goal review, and was identified as an important priority to address by the bilaterally agreed-upon Terms of Reference and by the TWG and independent reviewers. Some of the aggregation approaches described in Section 2.5, including status-based methods and forward simulation modelling, are more suitable than others, such as estimating the aggregate-level MSY, for incorporating stock-level diversity into management targets. The ongoing management engagement process has focused on using forward simulation modelling, to explore tradeoffs between harvests and biological risks, and the simulation outputs can provide information about what spawner abundances are associated with the highest number of stocks achieving biological objectives. The simulations show that under recent productivity, harvests will peak at lower aggregate spawner targets than would maximize the number of healthy stocks.


### Time-varying Productivity {#ImportantTimeVar}

Sockeye salmon populations are changing rapidly with the cumulative effects of stressors including fishing pressure and climate change. Skeena and Nass Sockeye stocks have seen declining productivity, together with increasing variability and increased frequency of low returns since 2000. Skeena and Nass Sockeye are now among a growing list of major British Columbia Sockeye salmon populations (along with Rivers Inlet, Smith Inlet, and Fraser Sockeye), which once supported large scale Canadian commercial fisheries, that are now constrained by low returns and associated conservation efforts. The four lowest Nass Sockeye returns were recorded from 2017-2022. For Skeena Sockeye, the lowest escapements since the catastrophic Babine landslide in the 1950s occurred in 2013, 2017, and 2019. 

Although the temporal patterns of variation in productivity vary by stock, a general pattern of decline is evident across stocks:

* Patterns in the spawner-recruit data for individual stocks as well as the Skeena and Nass aggregates (i.e., spawners, observed recruits per spawner).
* Ricker residuals (i.e., observed productivity compared to productivity predicted by fitted models).
* decline in the productivity parameter (alpha) for many of the stocks where sufficient data are available to fit stock-specific Ricker models with time-varying productivity. 
* Consistent shared-year effect in the HBM model results across the Skeena Sockeye stocks, finding a similar pattern of decline in productivity as for single-stock Ricker fit for the Skeena aggregate data set.

Further, there is evidence that size-at-age, and fecundity for Skeena and Nass Sockeye have decreased in recent decades. Anecdotally, long time commercial fishermen targeting Skeena Sockeye report switching to smaller-mesh nets (from 5 1/2” to 4 ¾” beginning in the 1980s. Population-level changes in body size, age composition, or size-at-age have been observed in all species of salmon in different regions throughout North America [e.g., @Oke2020RecentDeclinesBodySize; @Ohlbergeretal2020CkEscQual; @SchaulGeiger2016ClimateCoho]. The patterns of decline in overall length and length-at-age for Skeena and Nass Sockeye are consistent with decreases of similar magnitudes that have been observed for Sockeye salmon populations in Southeast Alaska [e.g., @Oke2020RecentDeclinesBodySize]. 

For Skeena Sockeye sampled at the Tyee Test Fishery, length at age decreased by 2-3% for 5, 6 and 7 year old fish and remained constant for 4 year old fish between the 1980s and 2010s. The overall length of Nass Sockeye sampled at Meziadin Fishway since 2010 is substantially less than the historic average, indicating shifts in age composition combined with decreases in body length of sampled fish. The observed decreases in overall size for sampled populations of Skeena and Nass Sockeye, together with observed decreases in fecundity of approximately 13% for fish sampled at the Babine spawning channels, indicate a trend toward decreased reproductive with implications for both wild and enhanced Sockeye populations. Escapement goals that assume constant egg production over time may not account for these patterns of decline in escapement quality.

Together with low returns and apparent declines in reproductive potential, Skeena and Nass Sockeye are facing increased frequencies of extreme environmental conditions. For example, Skeena Sockeye from the 2013 brood year, which was itself the lowest Skeena Sockeye return since the years immediately following the Babine slide, experienced extreme environmental conditions throughout their life history. The spawning channels did not meet their loading targets in 2017, 2017 and 2019, and smolts which migrated to sea in 2015 encountered a marine heatwave that persisted from 2014 to 2016 that was extreme in intensity, geographic range, and the unusual depth of anomalous temperatures [@Rossetal2021Heatwaves]. 4- and 5-year old Sockeye that returned in 2017 and 2018 encountered drought conditions and extreme temperatures during the return migration and on the spawning grounds. While each of these events are system specific, and anecdotal examples of what were previously thought to be rare events, there is no question that extreme events are occurring at an increasing frequency.

Maintaining healthy and diverse Sockeye salmon populations for Skeena and Nass Sockeye will require planning for these extreme events, which may include developing escapement goals and management strategies that can adapt and rapidly respond to changing conditions, such as mitigating for extreme temperatures as has been practiced for Fraser Sockeye [@FraserSKEnroute; @FraseSkMgmtAdjFAO2021]. Maintaining population diversity will also help to buffer for aggregate populations from the likelihood of future catastrophic events, which should be considered in fisheries management, including the development of escapement goals. While fisheries managers cannot predict climate-related or other catastrophic events on a year-to-year basis, the probability of bad outcomes can be reduced by introducing buffers to mitigate risk, and by maintaining stock-level diversity within the Skeena and Nass metapopulations [@Andersonetal2015Portfolio].

A key finding of the data review was that many Skeena and Nass Sockeye stocks and both aggregates had dramatically lower recruitment productivity in recent years compared with the long-term average. Our subsequent analyses focused on exploring the performance of stocks under different productivity scenarios, and specifically compared results generated using spawner recruitment parameters developed using long-term average productivity with recent productivity (Tables \@ref(tab:ProdCompTab2) and  \@ref(tab:ProdCompBMRatioSmsy)). While decision makers need to consider that lower productivities are likely to continue in the future, we included results based on long-term average productivity to illustrate the contrast and magnitudes of difference based on different productivity assumptions. More work needs to be done to incorporate different productivity variations, including different definitions of “recent” productivity, into the current framework.  Potential future work on alternative scenarios may include environment considerations and bound likely futures based on known relationships (potentially stock by stock relationship differences may be leveraged based on existing/ongoing work).


## KEY CONCLUSIONS {#KeyConclusions}


### Alternative SR Model Fits and Productivity Scenarios

#### Alternative SR Model Forms

We explored three alternative SR model forms, which was informative because (1) the comparison between them helped with understanding the properties of each stock-specific SR data set, and (2) parameter estimates from different model forms could be used for different purposes.

For stocks with complete time series, where all three SR model forms could be fitted, the following observations are noteworthy:

* given the strong temporal trends in residuals, the AR1 Ricker fit improved the statistical properties of the fit compared to the Basic Ricker fit. Therefore, we chose parameters from the AR1 fit to generate the long-term-average productivity scenario, where available.
* productivity patterns identified through the TVP model fit with time-varying productivity differed between stocks, and in some cases the productivity patterns tracked the residuals from the Basic Ricker fit very closely (i.e., did not identify a smooth underlying pattern). These highly variable productivity patterns need to be interpreted with caution, but can still serve as a useful source of parameter estimates for alternative productivity scenarios (i.e., give a high contrast to the high and low productivity bookend scenarios). Therefore, we used the TVP parameter estimates for different time periods to generate alternative productivity scenarios, where available. TVP fits generally resulted in more uncertain estimates of the productivity parameter (i.e., wider ln.alpha posteriors), but in more precise estimates of capacity (i.e., narrower Smax posteriors).

#### Biological Benchmarks

The Nass Sockeye aggregate includes 9 different CUs which were combined into 7 stocks for our analyses, while the Skeena aggregate includes 30 extant CUs, which were combined into 24 stocks for our analyses. For both aggregates, spawner-recruitment based biological benchmarks were developed for each of the major contributing stocks. Productivity for the different Nass and Skeena stocks varies across time, with the aggregate stocks, and their largest components (Meziadin and Babine wild stocks) exhibiting near-continual declines in recruits per spawner, and the productivity parameter from single stock fits, since 2000 (Figures \@ref(fig:FitsCompProd1) and \@ref(fig:FitsCompProd2)). Plausible alternative productivity scenarios were developed to characterize high, low, long-term average, and recent productivity scenarios by sampling from the posterior distributions for the Ricker-alpha parameter from the most appropriate available models for each scenario.

Biological benchmarks were estimated for the different Skeena and Nass Sockeye stocks using the parameter distributions generated from the alternative productivity scenarios. These were used to build illustrations of equilibrium probability profiles and aggregate reference points that can be used to inform choices for aggregate escapement goals, once management objectives have been clearly defined.

Extensive testing showed that benchmark estimates for some stocks were highly sensitive to one or more of the following:

* *Data treatments* (Appendix \@ref(AltSRTest)): Filtering out brood years with R/S > 45 made a big difference in benchmark estimates for some stocks, and we consider this a necessary quality-control step. If this results in very different benchmark estimates, it indicates that 1 or 2 extreme values had a big effect, and should be investigated carefully. In contrast, infilling missing values generally had little effect on benchmark estimates, because we infilled  using average values, and the infilling did not generate any extreme points. For stocks where the infilling made a difference in the Basic Ricker estimate, this is due to the age structure of Sockeye salmon. A single missing year of spawner and run size estimates can exclude 3-5 brood years from the SR data set. For example, infilling two return year data points for Kitsumkalum added 8 brood years to the SR data set, but only changed the median Smsy estimate by 6%. Infilling five return year data points for Asitka more than doubled the available SR data from 11 brood years to 24 brood years, but also changed resulting estimates substantially (Smsy: -21%, ln.alpha: -41%).
* *Benchmark calculations* (Appendix \@ref(BMCalcTest)): Estimates of biological benchmarks were insensitive to alternative formulations (<2%), but the success rate varied for alternative implementations of the Sgen optimizer. We used the @Scheuerell2016 method to calculate Smsy, because it is the only exact solution, and the @Connorsetal2022 version of the Sgen optimizer, because it was the only non-brute-force method that did not crash for any of the tested parameter combinations.
* *Bayesian estimation*: Median Bayesian benchmark estimates from the Basic Ricker model fits were similar to the simple deterministic estimates for most stocks. Those stocks that were flagged as more than 25% different from the deterministic estimate (Figure \@ref(fig:FitsCompDetFig)) also had more uncertain Bayesian estimates (i.e., very wide posteriors), and were highly sensitive to alternative capacity priors (Figure \@ref(fig:FitsCompCapPrior)).

While estimates for smaller stocks with noisier and incomplete SR data were generally more sensitive than larger stocks with higher quality data, it was not always the same stocks that were flagged in different sensitivity tests. SR fits  for the enhanced stocks and for aggregate-level SR data, in particular, were highly sensitive to alternative SR model assumptions, even though the quality of each individual spawner and recruit estimate was high.


#### Comparing Single-stock and Aggregate Model Fits

Although calculating SR model fits for aggregate data is computationally simple, the resulting parameters are not appropriate for developing management targets. 

For the Skeena aggregate, the majority of effective spawners, and most of the adult returns, are from the BLDP enhancement facilities on Pinkut and Fulton. We explored model fits for a SkeenaWild aggregate that excluded the enhanced stocks, but this level of analysis masked the diversity of stock-specific productivity patterns identified in the stock-level analyses, particularly the substantial recent decline in productivity for several of the wild Skeena stocks with complete (or infilled complete) time series. 

For the Nass aggregate, two stocks with very different life histories and production dynamics account for most of the abundance. Historically, the Nass run was mostly from Meziadin lake-type Sockeye, but in recent years Lower Nass Sea and River Type Sockeye have increased both in absolute abundance and relative contribution. We consider it more appropriate, therefore, to model these two stocks separately, rather than in a combined SR data set.


#### Comparing Single-stock and Hierarchical SR Model Fits

At the beginning of their WinBUGS manual, @WinBUGSManual remind users in bold, red font: *"Beware: MCMC sampling can be dangerous"*. Computing power continues to increase and MCMC software continues to evolve (e.g., from WinBUGS to JAGS to STAN), but the basic challenge remains the same: If estimates are highly sensitive to model structure and prior assumptions, which version is the most “correct”? 

Extensive sensitivity testing  is standard practice in Bayesian estimation. However, in this project we had the rare opportunity of comparing two completely separate and fundamentally different implementations of the same type of SR model fit to the exact same original data set. Extensive sensitivity testing was conducted for both model implementations, but it was only through direct comparison between the two implementations that we were able to identify sources for the discrepancies. Most of the initial large differences in benchmark estimates were not due to the hierarchical structure, but resulted from alternative specifications of the capacity prior (Smax). Differences were more pronounced for stocks where the data didn't have a strong density-dependent signal (i.e., "noisy" scatterplot), which were flagged as highly sensitive in both sets of analyses. 

The ability to compare independent model implementations served as an important reminder that Bayesian estimation can be very sensitive to prior assumptions and structural differences. Resulting estimates need to be ground-truthed based on biological expertise, and the stock-specific uncertainty of the estimates needs to be considered in subsequent uses of the results. 

The implications of observed differences between estimates will differ depending on how the information is used. For example, if a subsequent decision process focuses on the sum of stock-level Smsy estimates, then large relative differences in the Smsy estimates for a few small stocks will not substantially affect the decision. If, however, a decision process focuses on status assessments that incorporate relative abundance benchmarks, such as Sgen and 80% Smsy, then large differences in benchmark estimates can translate into a very different overall status picture, which could strongly influence decisions that are made based on these assessments.

Similarly, stock-specific estimated patterns in productivity differed between single-stock and hierarchical model fits. Both sets of results can be useful, and  a direct comparison is informative. The shared-year effect in the hierarchical model looks for a common pattern across stocks, and two types of  sensitivity tests can be used to investigate the estimated patterns: 

* *top-down*: McAllister and Challenger (Appendix \@ref(app:HBMFits)) started with a hierarchical model form that included 18 modelled Skeena stocks, and then dropped one or more stocks from the analysis. In these tests, the common shared year effect was not sensitive to alternative combinations of  16-17 stocks.
* *bottom-up*: An alternative approach might be to begin by fitting hierarchical models with smaller groups of stocks and explore how the shared year effect differs for these smaller groups. For example, hierarchical model fits could be tested for (1) just the three wild Babine stocks, (2) all five Babine stocks, (3) all wild  middle Skeena lake-type Sockeye stocks with SR data, (4) all lower Skeena lake-type stocks with SR data, and (5) all upper Skeena lake-type stocks with SR data. Based on these explorations, a hierarchical model with a more nuanced spatial structure could then be developed.


### Alternative Approaches for Developing Aggregate Management Reference Points {#AggregationComparison}

This Research Document presents alternative biological benchmarks for Skeena and Nass Sockeye stocks along with a number of different approaches for developing aggregate reference points. Specific choices about how to use the information presented here, including the eventual choices for updated escapement goals for Skeena and Nass Sockeye will be made once management objectives are defined in subsequent processes, including a multistakeholder evaluation process to select an escapement goal for Skeena and Nass Sockeye which is currently underway.  

While these processes will involve different individuals and will unfold at different timelines, they all rely on the same fundamental information: (1) agreed-upon spawner-recruit data, and (2) agreed-upon approach for fitting spawner-recruit models, and (3) agreed-upon approach for calculating the resulting biological benchmarks. How the data, model fits, and biological benchmarks are considered will also differ between the processes, so we focused on the fundamental information, but also illustrate how it could be used. The approaches presented here are intended to be flexible to incorporating new information if required by the decision-making process, for example it is expected that model fits and biological benchmarks will change as data sets are updated in the future. The data sets and tools, or building blocks, presented here, are intended to provide a starting point for the decision-making process, rather than prescriptive recommendations for the choices that will eventually be made.

#### Requirements for the Escapement Goal Review

Revised escapement goals for Skeena and Nass Sockeye are required for implementing Pacific Salmon Treaty provisions. Following the evaluation of alternative approaches against selection criteria developed by a group of CSAS meeting participants, subsequent work focused on developing a refined version of the forward simulation model, along with equilibrium tradeoff profiles to evaluate tradeoffs during the management engagement process.

* *Equilibrium tradeoff plots*: Equilibrium probability profiles estimate expected yield for a given stock under different productivity scenarios. For example, the equilibrium profiles for Meziadin Sockeye  illustrate the probabilities of attaining 60 or 80% of long-term average MSY, or an equilibrium yield greater than 100,000 under long-term average or recent productivity scenarios (Figure \@ref(fig:ProfileMezidian)). These results suggest that for Meziadin Sockeye, there is a very low likelihood of attaining any of these objectives under current conditions.
* *Simulation-based reference points*: Simulation models can be used to explore tradeoffs between aggregate catch and biological risks to individual populations within each river system, across a range of aggregate escapement goals, and identify aggregate spawning goals that maximize catch, stock health, or other specified performance metrics. For the initial version of this Research Document, we built a simple simulation model to illustrate the type of information that can be incorporated in a management strategy evaluation. The simulation model was then refined following discussion at the CSAS peer review meeting and recommendations from some participants and independent reviewers to incorporate outcome uncertainty and covariation in productivity. These modifications are described in Appendix \@ref(ModelExt).

In this paper we demonstrate the potential benefits of forward simulations that generate expected trajectories under alternative assumptions. A key finding was that the responses to different harvest strategies were highly sensitive to the productivity assumption. Not surprisingly, projected abundances are lower under recent productivity scenarios than under long-term average productivity for most Skeena and Nass Sockeye stocks. The simulation also identified counter-intuitive interactions between productivity scenarios and alternative harvest strategies. For escapement goals below the current interim escapement goals, more stocks achieve the 3-generation objective under the recent productivity scenario than under the long-term average productivity scenario. Under long-term average productivity, aggregate run sizes are larger due to productive large stocks, and these run sizes translate into larger target ER, which in turn impacts less productive, smaller stocks (Figures \@ref(fig:TradeoffPlotSkeenaWildLTAvg) to \@ref(fig:TradeoffPlotNassRecent)). 

Future model extensions could address other considerations, such as area and time-specific differences in harvest impacts, and future productivity. Such expansions need to be carefully bounded to focus on mechanisms that are relevant to the objectives of the analysis.


#### Requirements for Regional Salmon Initiatives

Regional salmon initiatives can also build on the examples of alternative aggregation approaches presented in this paper:

* *Aggregate limit reference points (LRP)*: New guidance [@LRPGuidelinesSAR] identifies two of the building blocks presented in this Research Document as candidate approaches for developing LRPs under the modernized *Fisheries Act* (2019). Specifically, the logistic regression results and illustration of multi-criteria status assessments included here lay the groundwork for a formal LRP process for Skeena and Nass Sockeye.
* *Multi-criteria status assessment*:  We illustrated status considerations for a single metric, abundance relative to biological benchmarks (Sgen, 80% Smsy), but actual status assessments under the  Wild Salmon Policy are based on a combination of multiple criteria (absolute abundance, long-term and short-term trends, distribution). Completing multi-criteria status assessments for Pacific salmon conservation units is a key deliverable of Wild Salmon Policy implementation.


## PRIORITIES FOR FUTURE WORK {#PrioritiesFuture}

Through the CSAS review process in April 2022, the follow-up process on comparing aggregation approaches, discussions with the independent reviewers, and feedback from the ongoing Canadian domestic engagement process, we have identified several critical areas for future work.

Each of these tasks presents considerable work, both in terms of analyses and process, and they cannot all be addressed at the same time, given their interconnectedness and requirement for input from  many of the same people. For example:

* Development of an aggregate LRP consistent with new guidelines requires multi-criteria status assessments of individual conservation units [@LRPGuidelinesSAR]. 
* Exploring alternative strategies for managing the the non-spawning surplus of enhanced Sockeye would require developing an improved and expanded simulation model. 
* Both of these analyses would require substantial participation from the same core group of DFO staff, and would need to be completed while they continue supporting annual operational requirements (e.g., PSC technical committees).

We anticipate that the ongoing Canadian domestic engagement process and bilateral Canada/U.S. discussions through the PSC will provide the next opportunities to develop guidance on priorities and scope for the next phases of work. We summarize potential tasks below to support the scoping discussions.


### Objectives

Regardless of which approach is chosen for developing aggregate management reference points for Skeena and Nass Sockeye, the application of that approach requires clearly defined quantitative objectives. We used various examples of quantitative objectives throughout this Research Document, but the larger escapement goal review process needs to develop four distinct types of agreed-upon objectives:

* *Quantitative objectives for individual wild stocks*: We focused our analyses on simple stock-level objectives linked to the lower and upper WSP benchmarks for relative abundance (Sgen, 80%Smy). However, other biological stock-level objectives should be explored, and stock-specific harvest objectives should be identified where possible (e.g., for specific in-river fisheries) 
* *Quantitative aggregate-level objectives*: Different aggregate-level objectives are either implicitly or explicitly required for applying the alternative approaches for developing aggregate management reference points. Several require an explicit definition of what constitutes success for each component stock, and then an explicit definition of what constitutes success for the aggregate. Focusing on wild stocks only, one example we used was *"At least 80% of stocks in the aggregate should have at least 80% probability of spawner abundance exceeding the upper WSP benchmark  for the relative abundance metric (80% Smsy under long-term average productivity) after 3 generations (simulation years 11-15)"*. However, many variations of objectives like this could be considered and tested, and an agreed-upon shortlist should be developed.
* *Quantitative objectives for individual enhanced stocks*: BLDP enhancement activities are currently managed under the general objective of maximizing smolt production under historical conditions, but this general goal should be reviewed given observed changes in the environment, in wild stocks, and in population dynamics of enhanced stocks. 
* *Quantitative objectives for the total Skeena aggregate, including wild and enhanced stocks*: There is currently no explicit policy guidance regarding the desired balance between biological objectives for wild stocks, production objectives for enhanced stocks, harvest objectives for combined wild and enhanced returns, and the unharvested, non-spawning surplus of enhanced returns. A formal management strategy evaluation (MSE), combining a simulation model and a structured participatory process, offers a comprehensive framework for identifying general objectives and key mechanisms, building a custom simulation model to test alternative scenarios, and refine both the analyses and objectives over time.

### Data

The natural and social system in which we are collectively trying to manage Skeena and Nass Sockeye is rapidly changing and annual assessment programs are adapting to changes in stocks, fisheries, and available tools. As a result, the data foundation available for the Skeena and Nass Sockeye escapement goal review is continuously evolving, which affects the priorities for both analyses and process. For example, emerging DNA-based stock identification may provide better estimates of stock-specific harvest impacts. Similarly, new information is being developed about the most appropriate methods for estimating spawner escapements for two stocks (Bowser, Bear). 

The analyses presented in this Research Document used SR data up to the 2019 returns, after an in-depth review of source data [@SkeenaNassSkDataRep]. Returns in 2020, 2021, and 2022, which are not incorporated in the current analysis, were unusual for many of the stocks, and may substantially affect parameter estimates. As data are updated  and SR parameter estimates revisited, the specific values of biological benchmarks, and the results of any chosen aggregation approach will also change. However, regular updates of run reconstructions, SR fits, status assessments, and simulation reruns are a substantial task. Planning for regular updates needs to fit this task in the context of all the prioritized tasks.     

### Spawner-recruit Modelling and Productivity Scenarios

The SR analyses presented in this paper include extensive sensitivity testing (3 single-stock model forms, 4 alternative capacity priors, alternative data treatments, alternative benchmark estimation approaches, single-stock vs. hierarchical Bayesian fits). Discussions during the peer review process identified several areas for further exploration:

* *Alternative capacity priors*:	We tested four combinations with either uniform or lognormal distributions and either wide or capped bounds on the distribution. The bounds were selected based on available information for each stock, including 
lake capacity estimates based on photosynthetic rate, largest observed spawner abundance, and Bayesian posterior distributions from an initial round of SR model fits. Alternative implementations of the log-normal capacity prior and alternative bounds on the capacity prior could be tested to further explore the sensitivity of resulting SR parameter estimates for stocks with highly uncertain capacity estimates. This was identified as a priority, because large initial differences between the single-stock and hierarchical Bayesian model fits were traced to differences in how the capacity priors were set up.
* *Stochastic simulations of bias*:	Potential biases in SR parameter estimates could arise from different implementation details (e.g., data treatment, model forms, capacity priors, Bayesian MCMC implementation). While we did extensive sensitivity testing, a more formal exploration of potential biases could generate many random data sets for hypothetical stocks with known population dynamics designed to be similar to the different Skeena and Nass Sockeye stocks, then apply the alternative SR model fitting variations to test which version produces estimates most similar to the "true" values.
* *Model Form switching*: For stocks with complete SR data sets (i.e., no missing years) the current implementation of alternative productivity scenarios sampled parameters from the AR1 Ricker fit for the long-term average productivity scenario and from the most recent generation of the time-varying productivity (TVP) Ricker fit for the recent productivity scenario. Some peer review participants expressed concern over potential implications of using different model forms for the productivity scenarios. Alternative versions of the long-term average productivity scenario, based on the TVP model fit could be explored (e.g., sample from all brood years instead of just the most recent generations, or calculate the average ln.alpha across brood years for each MCMC parameter set).
* *Alternative hierarchical structure for the HBM model fit*: As discussed in Section \@ref(KeyConclusions) above, different assumptions about the hierarchical structure of Skeena Sockeye could be tested within the estimation framework developed by McAllister and Challenger (Appendix \@ref(app:HBMFits)).

### Enhanced Pinkut and Fulton

Priorities for future work relate to stock assessment, channel management, interactions with wild stocks, and alternative approaches for developing a combined enhanced-wild harvest strategy. Specific tasks include:

* *Review of channel loading targets*: We included an overview of egg, fry and smolt production data and trends in this report.  An in-depth analysis of enhanced Babine Sockeye production, which is part of a larger review of the effectiveness of salmon hatcheries in the Pacific Region, led by Pacific Salmon Foundation, is ongoing (Cam West, pers. comm., DFO Salmonid Enhancement Program (retired), 2021). However, this work only addresses technical components of channel production, with a focus on enhanced Babine Sockeye. A broader integrated review is needed to determine how channel management should respond to these observed biological changes. 
* *Investigate biological interactions between enhanced and wild populations*: Although egg, fry and smolt production data for Babine Lake suggest freshwater density dependence with reductions in smolt size associated with higher fry production, more work is needed to understand the longer term effects of BLDP enhancement on wild Babine and other Skeena Sockeye populations, including updated information about changes in freshwater rearing capacity for Babine Lake, and a detailed analysis of size selective marine survival and recruitment across a range of ocean conditions. Improvements to genetic resolution between the different Babine stocks may inform a better understanding of the potential for straying between populations.    
* *Investigate indirect interactions between enhanced and wild populations through aggregate abundance, aggregate harvest rules, and mixed-stock fisheries*: This would likely involve an expanded simulation model with a distinct component for population dynamics of the enhanced stocks and a finer resolution of simulated harvest (e.g., different wild and enhanced harvests based on fishery timing, location, and gear).
* *Review of surplus management*: Our SR analyses and resulting building blocks for aggregate management reference points focused on the wild stocks. However, harvest management of Skeena Sockeye needs to find a balance between wild stock considerations, operational considerations for the enhanced stocks, and the interaction between biological surplus from the channel stocks with aggregate harvest rates on the combined returns of wild and enhanced stocks. These challenges, which are not new to Skeena Sockeye fisheries management, apply regardless of the chosen approach for setting aggregate targets (e.g., probability profiles vs. forward simulation).


### Incorporating Biological Considerations in Aggregate Management Reference Points

Changing productivity was identified as the highest analytical priority by scoping workshop participants, technical WG members, and independent reviewers for the Skeena and Nass Sockeye escapement goal review. In this paper we present an approach for selecting SR model parameters that describe alternative productivity scenarios, and we show the implications for resulting estimates of biological benchmarks and any considerations based on these benchmarks. The importance of considering time-varying productivity is discussed in Section \@ref(ImportantTimeVar) above. Specific priorities for future work include:

* *Identifying productivity regimes*: Our analyses included an approach for generating alternative productivity scenarios (i.e., long-term average vs. recent), but we did not analyze observed time trends in productivity to look for evidence with discrete shifts in productivity (i.e., regimes). Analyses like @Rodionov2005Regimes can identify shifting productivity regimes, and assist with bounding future productivity scenarios (e.g., for forward simulation). 
* *Guidance for considering productivity changes in biological benchmarks and management reference points*: Identifying past changes in productivity is an important step, but there are many conceptual challenges with incorporating this information into a management context. For example, if recent productivity is lower than average, then Smsy estimates under a recent productivity assumption will generally also be lower. Should escapement goals be lowered in years of poor productivity, or should they stay the same to avoid ratcheting down abundance over the long-term, or should they increase to speed up rebuilding? A multi-year research initiative started in the summer of 2022 to develop formal guidance  for management considerations under changing productivity (Carrie Holt and Brendan Connors, pers. comm., DFO, 2022).
* *Incorporating demographic changes into escapement goals*: For populations that are undergoing changes in escapement quality such as reduction in body size, fecundity or sex ratio, escapement goals that assume constant egg production may underestimate the number of spawners required to achieve objectives such as maximum sustained yield, or targets for fry production [@Staton2021]. Some of these changes have been observed in Skeena and Nass Sockeye, and a more detailed analysis is needed to assess whether these changes are likely to represent significant shifts in recruitment that will need to be considered in management targets for these stocks. Alternative approaches for incorporating demographic changes into escapement may need to be considered, such as considering escapement goals based on egg production rather than spawner abundance, or incorporating demographic change explicitly into spawner recruitment modeling, like the alternative escapement goal adjustments explored  in @Connorsetal2022 for Yukon Chinook.
