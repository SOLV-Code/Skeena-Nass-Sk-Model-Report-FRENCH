This Research Document focuses on SR modelling for wild Sockeye stocks (16 Skeena, 4 Nass), but corresponding SR data, parameter estimates and benchmark estimates for Pinkut and Fulton are included here as a reference. Note, however, that these should not be used given SR model fitting issues and management differences discussed in Section \@ref(AltApproachEnhanced).

Observed productivity, in terms of ln(R/S), does not show a clear density-dependent pattern (Figures \@ref(fig:RpSPlotPinkut) and \@ref(fig:RpSPlotFulton)). This is due to a combination of spawning channel development, annual channel management, natural variation in productivity, density-dependence, and uncertain estimates of spawners and recruits, especially linked to estimating the non-spawning surplus (Section \@ref(SurplusEst)). Given this noisy data, Bayesian estimates of Ricker model parameters are highly sensitive to alternative data treatment assumptions (as illustrated for the Skeena aggregate in Figure \@ref(fig:AltFitPlotSkeena)) as well as alternative priors on productivity and capacity (i.e., the y-intercept and slope of a line fitted through the scatterplot in Figures \@ref(fig:RpSPlotPinkut) and \@ref(fig:RpSPlotFulton) is strongly affected by what we set as a plausible starting point). 

Biological benchmarks for Pinkut are substantially lower under the recent productivity scenario (Table \@ref(tab:BMTableLTAvgPinkut)) than  under the long-term average productivity scenario (Table \@ref(tab:BMTableNowPinkut)). For Fulton, the benchmarks are quite similar, with Smax, Smsy, and Seq a bit lower under recent productivity than under long-term average productivity, and Sgen a bit higher (Table \@ref(tab:BMTableLTAvgFulton)  vs. Table \@ref(tab:BMTableNowFulton)).

(ref:RpSPlotPinkut) Ln(R/S) Plot - Pinkut. Scatter plot of log productivity ln(R/S) vs. spawner abundance. Observations are colour-coded, with earlier data in fainter shading. The secondary axis illustrates the corresponding raw R/S values. Variations of the Ricker model attempt to fit a straight line through this scatter of points. The y axis intercept of the fitted line captures intrinsic productivity (i.e., R/S at very low spawner abundance) and the slope reflects the capacity (i.e., a steeper slope means more of a density-dependent reduction for each additional spawner, indicating lower capacity).

Variables with the ".c" suffix are the bias corrected version (e.g., Smsy vs. Smsy.c).
