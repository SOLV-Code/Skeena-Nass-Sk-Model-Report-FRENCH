Type,Label,Description
Capped Uniform,CU,All values between 0 and upper limit are equally likely. Upper limit generally set at 1.5 times the PR-based estimate or at 1.5 times the largest observed spawner abundance.  Scalar adjusted for some stocks based on review of posterior distributions from preliminary model fits.
Wide Uniform,WU,All values between 0 and upper limit are equally likely. Upper limit generally set at 3 times the PR-based estimate or at 3 times the largest observed spawner abundance. Scalar adjusted for some stocks based on review of posterior distributions from preliminary model fits.
Capped Lognormal,CL,Values between 0 and upper limit follow a skewed distribution with a long upper tail and a mean set the PR-based estimate or the largest observed spawner abundance.  Upper limit generally set at 3 times the mean. Mean and limit adjusted for some stocks based on review of posterior distributions from preliminary model fits.
Wide Lognormal,WL,Values between 0 and upper limit follow a skewed distribution with a long upper tail and a mean set the PR-based estimate or the largest observed spawner abundance.  Upper limit generally set at 5 times the mean. Mean and limit adjusted for some stocks based on review of posterior distributions from preliminary model fits.
