Type,Label,Description
Estimation,Time-varying parameters?,"Can incorporate time-varying parameters (e.g. fecundity, capacity, variance, productivity)"
Estimation,Uncertainty in SR model fits?,"Explicitly accounts for uncertainty in SR model fits that arises from natural process variation and observation (i.e., measurement) error"
Estimation,Outcome uncertainty?,Can explicitly incorporate differences between target and actual escapement or exploitation rates?
Estimation,Productivity covariation?,Can explicitly incorporate observed or alternative future covariation in productivity among stocks?
Estimation,Bias in parameter estimates?,"Can bias in Smsy, Umsy, the Ricker alpha, and the Ricker beta parameters be explicitly evaluated?  For example, as a function of number of data points, average stock productivity, time variation in productivity, and previous harvest rates (the last two variables affect contrast in data), etc."
Outcome,Can get abundance-based Agg RP?,Can produce an abundance-based aggregate reference point?
Outcome,Can test state dependent HCR?,Can this method produce and test harvest control rules that respond to changing conditions?
Outcome,Data-deficient stocks?,Can this method account for stocks currently without SR data?
Outcome,Allows taking into account component stocks?,Explicitly provides estimates of current or future biological status of component populations and other stock-specific information so that decision makers can evaluate trade-offs?
Implement-ation,Can be easily operationalized?,"Easily operationalized in bilateral and domestic management setting. For example, does it align with Limit Reference Points under the Fisheries Act (DFO 2022)?"
Implement-ation,Time requirements,"Implementation time frame after data review and SR model fitting. Short = short-term is possible (can calculate from SR parameters immediately), Medium = medium-term process required (at least 6 months), Long = multi-year process required."
