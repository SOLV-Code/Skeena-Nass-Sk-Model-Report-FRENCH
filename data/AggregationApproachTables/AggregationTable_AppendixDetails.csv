Method,Criterion,Comment
Agg Smsy,Time-varying parameters?,MAYBE. Depends on how the SR parameters are estimated and how results for alternative productivity scenarios are carried through to the final Smsy estimate used as a management target.
Agg Smsy,Uncertainty in SR model fits?,"YES. Using Bayesian parameter estimates that quantify the uncertainty in model parameters. Alternative approaches could be implemented (e.g., state-space SR model with explicit CV for each observation, or an integrated RunRecon/SR state-space model that combines uncertainty in spawner and catch data, age composition, and SR model fitting). "
Agg Smsy,Outcome uncertainty?,NO. Outcome uncertainty not part of the calculation.
Agg Smsy,Productivity Covariation?,"NO. Patterns in productivity for the aggregate can be accounted for in the SR model fitting step (e.g., AR1 Ricker model, random-walk alpha model), but covariation between component stocks is not explicitly considered in the resulting aggregate reference points."
Agg Smsy,Bias in parameter estimates?,"MAYBE. Depends on the situation. The magnitude and direction of bias is affected by the number of data points, average stock productivity, time variation in productivity, and previous harvest rates (the last two factors affect contrast in data)."
Agg Smsy,Can get abundance-based Agg RP?,"YES.  Aggregate goal can be selected directly based on posterior distribution (mean, median, or percentile range)."
Agg Smsy,Can get harvest control rule?,NO.  Produces only a single reference point or range.
Agg Smsy,Data-deficient stocks?,NO. Component stocks not part of the calculation.
Agg Smsy,Allows taking into account component stocks?,NO.  Stock or CU level information not used in SR model fitting or aggregation approach.
Agg Smsy,Can be easily operationalized?,YES. Can be operationalized subject to considerations of timeline and type of mgmt setting.
Agg Smsy,Time requirements,SHORT. Can be calculated directly from SR parameter set for each productivity scenario.

Sum of Smsy,Can get abundance-based Agg RP?,"MAYBE.  Aggregate goal is the sum of either median or mean stock-level estimates.  This is not appropriate as an aggregate goal, but could be used as a lower bound on aggregate spawner abundance. Percentile bounds cannot be easily calculated for the sum. "
Sum of Smsy,Can get harvest control rule?,NO.  Produces only a single refernce point.
Sum of Smsy,Data-deficient stocks?,NO. Only uses available Smsy estimates.
Sum of Smsy,Allows taking into account component stocks?,"NO.  Stock-level information used in SR model fitting, but aggregation approach excludes data deficient stocks and down-weights small stocks. Given stock composition of Nass and SkeenaWild aggregates, this approach is equivalent to managing for Smsy of the largest stock in each aggregate, with the implicit assumption that relative stock contribution will persist as it has been."

Umsy Comp,Data-deficient stocks?,NO. Only uses available Umsy estimates.

If a target aggregate ER is chosen based on the most abundant stocks or based on long-term average productivity, then NO. "

Alternative approaches could be implemented (e.g., state-space SR model with explicit CV for each observation, or an integrates RunRecon/SR state-space model that combines uncertainty in spawner and catch data, age composition, and SR model fitting). "
Log Reg,Outcome uncertainty?,NO. Outcome uncertainty not part of the calculation.
Log Reg,Productivity Covariation?,"MAYBE. This approach assumes covariation in abundance (i.e., years with larger aggregate abundance generally have larger abundance for the component stocks). This was observed for Skeena Wild stocks, but not for Nass stocks in a preliminary exploration."

Once these are available, then some time wil; be required to implement the calculations consistent with the guidelines."
Sim,Time-varying parameters?,MAYBE. Depends on how the SR parameters are estimated and how results for alternative productivity scenarios are carried through to the final result.
Sim,Uncertainty in SR model fits?,"YES. Using Bayesian parameter estimates that quantify the uncertainty in model parameters. Alternative approaches could be implemented (e.g., state-space SR model with explicit CV for each observation, or an integrates RunRecon/SR state-space model that combines uncertainty in spawner and catch data, age composition, and SR model fitting). "
Sim,Outcome uncertainty?,"YES. Alternative assumptions regarding outcome uncertainty can be explicitly modelled, but may be difficult to parameterize from past observation given changing structure of fisheries, evolving in-season assessment (e.g., stock ID) and evolving management approach. Need to plan for extensive sensitivity testing."
Sim,Productivity Covariation?,"YES. Alternative assumptions regarding covariation can be explicitly modelled, but may be difficult to parameterize from past observation given different covariation observed through different time periods (e.g., different 20yr time windows) and changing stock characteristics (e.g., shifts in run timing, fecundity, different lake responses to environmental changes). Need to plan for extensive sensitivity testing."
Sim,Bias in parameter estimates?,"YES. Alternative harvest control rules can be evaluated to determine which ones best meet management objectives across the variety of situations that affect magnitude and direction of bias. This can be done my simulating various scenarios that include different numbers of data points, average stock productivity, time variation in productivity, and previous harvest rates."
Sim,Can get abundance-based Agg RP?,"MAYBE. Can produce aggregate abundance reference points, but Fixed Escapement is only one of the alternative types of harvest control rule that can be evaluated by forward simulation. Other types may outperform a Fixed Escapement policy based on chosen objectives."
Sim,Can get harvest control rule?,"YES. Alternative  harvest control rules can be explicitly tested from simplified aggregate rules (fixed ER, fixed esc, ER that changes with abundance) to fishery-specific in-season harvest rules. Level of detail that can be tested depends on model structure. More detailed questions require more complex models. "
Sim,Data-deficient stocks?,MAYBE. Could add proxies for data deficient stocks to the simulation.
Sim,Allows taking into account component stocks?,"YES. Simulation trajectories for each stock and for the aggregate, under different assumptions, are evaluated against alternative objectives (e.g., % of stocks with Spn > 80% Smsy after 3 generations, median aggregate catch over 3 generations, variability in annual catch)."
Sim,Can be easily operationalized?,YES. Can be operationalized subject to considerations of timeline and type of mgmt setting.
Sim,Time requirements,"LONG. Full implementation requires a formal, iterative process for model scoping, scenario development, and interpretation of outputs (i.e., Management Strategy Evaluation, MSE). Simpler simulations, evaluated against ""typical"" objectives, can be developed faster. The main results presented in the Research Document are based on simple simulations, but include some examples of additional considerations as well (e.g., covariation in productivity, differential exploitation rate for stocks based on timing)."
