Approach,Objectives
Agg Smsy,"Maximum sustainable yield  (MSY), median over the long-term under stable conditions. Also implied choices: Fixed Esc strategy, manage to aggregate MSY, focus on largest stocks. "
Sum Smsy,"Maximum sustainable yield  (MSY), median over the long term under stable conditions. Also implied choices: Fixed Esc strategy, manage to aggregate MSY, focus on largest stocks. "
Umsy Comp,"Sustainable exploitation rate (Umsy) under long-term and recent productivity scenario to compare stock productivities, to identify upper bounds on aggregate ER."
Equ. Prof,"Implied: fixed Esc strategy, equilibrium conditions. Sample Objective: 80% prob of achieving 60% of MSY  (yield-focused)."
Agg TradeOff,"CONSERVATION: Number of stocks harvested at or below their estimated sustainable rate (Umsy) , HARVEST: Maximize aggregate harvest under equilibrium conditions."
Status,Define Red/Amber/Green status for relative abundance metric based on Sgen and 80% Smsy from long-term average productivity scenario. Sample objectives:  No more than x CUs in Red status zones.
Log Reg,Sample objective: 80% of stocks above Median Sgen from Long-term average productivity scenario. 
Sim,"CONSERVATION: Number of stocks with at least 80% probability of generational average spawner abundance exceeding a benchmark (Sgen and 80% Smsy from long-term average productivity scenario, 10th percentile of observed spawner abundance since 1990). HARVEST: Median total harvest over 3 generations."
