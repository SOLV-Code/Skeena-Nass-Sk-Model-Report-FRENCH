Seq,ModelComp,Notes
1,Productivity Scenario,"Productivity assumptions were identified as a key analytical priority for this project, and the alternative scenarios developed in this paper confirm it as one of the most influential model components. This remains a key priority for  future work."
2,Harvest Rule Type,"Fixed escapement strategies aim to stabilize spawner abundance and shift most of the annual variation in run size towards harvest, resulting in highly variable harvest amounts.  Fixed ER strategies aim to stabilize harvest rate, so that run size variation is split between variability in spawner abundance and variability in catch amount. These are well-known results from decades of fisheries modelling, and are observed in this model as well. "
3,ER floor and cap,"Adding these to a fixed escapement strategy tries to merge in some of the properties of a fixed ER strategy, at low and high run sizes. The closer the ER floor and ER cap are together, the less of a difference the specific escapement goal makes (i.e.,  the more the strategy becomes like a fixed ER strategy). The ER floor has more of an effect when aggregate run sizes are low (i.e., a low productivity scenario), while the ER cap has more of an effect when aggregate run sizes are larger (i.e., long-term average productivity). The figure on the next page shows some examples."
4,Aggregate outcome uncertainty,"This is currently modelled as a random error with mean = 0, so larger aggregate outcome uncertainty just results in less of a difference between alternative harvest strategies. Put another way, the specific target is less important when you have little chance of hitting the target."
5,Stock-specific outcome uncertainty,"This is modelled based on observed differences in ER, so several early migrating Skeena stocks are assumed to have lower ER than later migrating stocks, which increases the probability of meeting a biological objective for these early stocks. If we instead assume that all stocks in an aggregate are exposed to the same ER, then these stocks perform worse."
6,Covariation in productivity,"In sensitivity tests so far, this had much less effect than the other model components we explored, but further exploration is needed, given that this is a key consideration identified in previous work on other salmon stock aggregates."
7,Biological  and harvest objectives,"The exact definition of biological objectives does not affect the actual simulation outcomes, but it determines how they are presented, and in turn influences our interpretation.  For example, a  stock's simulated spawner abundance after 3 generations may have a moderate probability of meeting an ambitious benchmark and a high probability of meeting a much lower  benchmark. How we interpret the probability depends on how we think about the benchmark. For now, the simulation model generates results for many variations of objectives, but it is a priority for future planning processes to identify a short-list of agreed-upon quantitative objectives, so that consistent summaries of the simulation runs can be provided by analysts."
9,Simulation length,"The current round of simulations focused on 3 generations. With shorter simulations, the starting conditions have more influence on the outcome (i.e., a stock that is very depressed now may not rebuild in 3 generations even if ER is very low, but may rebuild over time). With longer simulations, the biological properties of the individual stocks have more influence on the outcome (i.e., a productive stock will do well, no matter what the current spawner abundance is that we start with).
