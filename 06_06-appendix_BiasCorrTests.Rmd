## EFFECT OF BIAS CORRECTION ON BENCHMARK ESTIMATES {#BiasCorrtest}

### Purpose

Preliminary benchmark estimates were flagged as potentially erroneous during the TWG process. Sgen values in particular seemed too low for several of the stocks. Once we verified the benchmark calculation code (Appendix \@ref(BMCalcTest)), we explored the effect of the log-normal bias correction for the productivity parameter alpha (Table \@ref(tab:BiasCorrCalcs)) on estimates of Smsy and Sgen. Note that this section refers to both the alpha parameter and the its natural log, ln.alpha, depending on the context.


### Approach


* Generated combinations of [alpha,sigma] that spanned the range of preliminary estimates for Skeena and Nass Sockeye stocks:
   * alpha parameters from 1.4 to 20 (ln.alpha from 0.336 to 3)
   * sigma parameters from 0.2 to 1.6
   * beta parameter does not affect the relative values, only the absolute scale, so fixed at  0.0005.
* Used @Scheuerell2016 method for Smsy, because it is the only exact solution. 
* Used @Connorsetal2022 method for Sgen, because it was the only non-brute-force method that did not crash for any of the [ln.alpha, b, s] combinations tested.
* Calculated Smsy and Sgen using either ln.alpha or ln.alpha' = ln.alpha + (sigma^2)/2
* Calculated the % differences due to bias correction for Smsy, Sgen, and the Ratio of Smsy/Sgen 
* Repeated the calculation with the simple deterministic parameter estimates (ln.alpha, beta, sigma) for those Skeena and Nass Sockeye stocks included in our analyses (i.e., wild stocks with at least 5 brood years of spawner-recruit data).



### Results

Larger sigmas resulted in small Smsy increases for stocks with higher intrinsic productivity (alpha >5, ln.alpha > 1.6), but resulted in substantial Smsy increases for lower productivity (alpha < 3, ln.alpha < 1.1). For example, Smsy roughly doubles (Perc diff = 100%) due to the bias correction for alpha = 1.5 and sigma = 1 (ln.alpha = 0.405, ln.alpha' = 0.905). Skeena and Nass Sockeye stocks fall on different gradients, with % difference due to bias correction ranging from ~5% to ~60% (Figure \@ref(fig:BiasCorrSmsyEffect)). Bias correction increased or decreased Sgen values, depending on the combination of ln.alpha and sigma (Figure \@ref(fig:BiasCorrSgenEffect)). Sgen decreases for all but one of the Skeena and Nass Sockeye stocks. For many stocks, Sgen decreased by more than 20%. The bias correction increased the distance between Smsy and Sgen as sigma increased (Figure \@ref(fig:BiasCorrRatioEffect)). For 3 stocks, the ratio of Smsy/Sgen more than doubled due to the bias correction.

Table \@ref(tab:TableBiasCorr) lists results by stock.


### Conclusions

Given these observed effects, we chose to report medians and percentiles without bias correction throughout this Research Document, but included the bias-corrected version in Appendix \@ref(BiasCorrectedBM). Section \@ref(BMMethods) describes how the bias correction is linked to how management objectives are defined.

(ref:BiasCorrSmsyEffect) Effect of Bias Correction on Smsy. Each line shows how, for a specific value of the alpha parameter, the difference between original and bias-corrected estimate changes as the sigma parameter increases. Uncertainty in the model fit increases from left to right, as sigma increases, resulting in a larger difference between estimates (i.e., lines curve upward). The effect of bias correction is larger at lower productivity (i.e., lower alpha parameter). Points show where each stock falls on the gradients of uncertainty and productivity, using a simple deterministic Ricker fit to all available data. The red horizontal line separates the results into the range where bias corrected estimates are larger than the original estimates (top) or lower than original estimates (bottom).
